# CalorieStat
[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

A web app that shows interesting statistics about the calories in your food. Shows how many bags of candy :candy: worth of calories are in your food and estimates how far you'd have to run to burn them off. Nutritional information comes from [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html).

Work in Progress.
